        "Description":"A long day should end with takeout and relaxing on the sofa. We can help with the second part. This sofa comes in several stunning color and fabric options that makes its design even more eye-catching. Two rows of button tufting; curved, flared arms; and tapered wood legs all contribute to the retro feel that's still popular today. Crafted from a kiln-dried hardwood frame, this piece features foam cushioning that's tightly wrapped with your choice of fabric. The three seat cushions are attached to keep things neat and tidy. Able to seat three people, this is a great option for smaller spaces that still need to appease a group. (Hello, movie night.)",
